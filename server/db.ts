// We'll simplify this file for now
// For a full implementation, we would need to include:
// import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
// import { Pool } from "pg";
// import * as schema from "@shared/schema";
//
// When using with a real database, we would:
// 1. Configure database connection
// 2. Create a pool
// 3. Create a drizzle instance
//
// For now, we're using in-memory storage

export const db = {
  // This is a placeholder for the db connection
  // Actual implementation would integrate with PostgreSQL
  initialized: false
